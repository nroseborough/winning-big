# winning-big

<b> Background </b>

As a passionate fan of the Baltimore Ravens, I asked my friends to place some casual bets on my team over the course of the season. Instead, they had me make a betting account and added me to a centralized messaging service, where I would watch them make large bets on outcomes that were essentially a coin toss. I would like to build a software system that tracks swings and conversions in sports betting odds to find bets with attractive odds that are likely to result in a payout.

<b> Execution </b>

By scraping a site with sports betting odds and comparing the odds at different times leading up to and during games, it may be possible to determine patterns and which bets are more likely to “hit” than the odds would suggest. For example, a team losing a basketball game by 10 points in the fourth quarter may only come back 8% of the time – but the odds might give them a 5% chance of winning the game. Comparing statistical outcomes of sporting events and their corresponding bets would make it possible to offer a more rational way for overeager gamblers to responsibly manage their money while still being able to emotionally and financial invest in a game. The data at hand is easily accessible, collecting it to calculate statistics is a straightforward affair, and this project would have extremely practical applications.
